# Developer System Setup for Mac OS X

> Prepares a Mac running OS X Mountain Lion (or higher) for polyglot software development. Run as many times as you like...no harm will be done (idempotency).

## Install

NOTE: On Mavericks (or higher), you can optionally skip steps #1 and #2; as the Xcode command-line tools are pre-loaded and just need to be installed.

### 1. Get/Install XCode

[![Xcode - Apple](http://r.mzstatic.com/images/web/linkmaker/badge_macappstore-lrg.gif)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12&uo=4)

### 2. Download "Command Line Tools"

Open Xcode

    % open -a Xcode

Navigate to "Downloads" with the following steps:

- Press `command + ,` to open "Preferences" pane.
- Click the "Downloads" tab (second to last tab).
- Select "Command Line Tools" and confirm to install.

### 3. Agree to the Xcode/iOS license

If you have skipped #2, you'll need to agree to the license:

    % sudo xcodebuild -license
    % sudo xcode-select --install

### 4. Install Homebrew

    % bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wilmoore/homebrew-home/master/go)
    % brew install python
    
    NOTE: Homebrew's python will make your life easier.

### 5. Install Dotfiles

    % git clone https://github.com/wilmoore/dotfiles /tmp/dotfiles
    % bash /tmp/dotfiles/setup
